# Kingdoms-of-Aloryith-Code-Samples
Repo for hosting code samples of my work in Unreal Engine.

This repo will essentially hold copied .h and .cpp files from various systems found in my game projects
in hopes of demonstrating my ability to program.

Each of the files found here are currently used inside of my WIP games,
and will be stored here when the given code works and is implemented in my game.
